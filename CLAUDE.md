# CLAUDE.md — Ka0s Premade Groups Filter Extension

**Ka0s WoW addon.** Adheres to the **Ka0s WoW Addon Standard** —
https://github.com/tusharsaxena/WowAddonStandards

## Standards compliance (read first)

This repo is built to the **Ka0s WoW Addon Standard** (URL above). All development here — features,
refactors, doc changes — MUST conform to it. The standard is the source of truth for layout, TOC
shape, the Ace substrate, schema-driven settings, slash/prefix conventions, locales, Compat,
tests/lint, and doc structure.

**If a change would deviate from the standard, STOP and flag the deviation explicitly.** Do not
silently deviate and do not silently "fix" to match. Surface it and let the user decide which of
two things it is:

1. **An accepted deviation** — this addon intentionally differs; record it as a row in
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` -> `## Documented deviations`, shaped
   `| Rule | What differs | Why | Decided | Re-check trigger |`. That register is the single home:
   a deviation not in it is not ratified.
2. **A change to the standard itself** — the standard's definition should evolve; the update
   belongs upstream in the WowAddonStandards repo, after which this addon conforms to the new rule.

No frozen compliance snapshot yet: the first audit lands in `docs/audits/` with plan Task 11. The
newest automated-test record is the 0.1.0 release run `docs/automated-tests/20261009-082905/`.

When in doubt, treat standard conformance as a hard requirement and ask.

Start here, then read the docs:

- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — module map, settings schema, slash surface, event wiring, taint
  notes, the PGF seams, known limitations, documented deviations. What this addon actually is.
  It also records the exact stand-down accessor and the test factory names later work must use.
- **`docs/testing.md`** — how to verify: the headless harness, lint, and the green commit gate.
- Topic detail in `docs/` as needed (`scope.md`, `module-map.md`, `schema.md`, `settings-panel.md`,
  `data-flow.md`, `common-tasks.md`, `smoke-tests.md`, …), registered in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ->
  `## Documentation map`.
- **`DEPENDENCIES.md`** — the toolchain contract: what to install to build, run, test or release.
- The M+ v0.1 plan and spec live in `docs/superpowers/`.

Green gate before every commit: `lua tests/run.lua` and `luacheck .` (0/0). Never edit `libs/` or
`tests/_kit/` (vendored; re-vendor instead). Never auto-stage/commit/push and never bump the version
without an explicit instruction.
